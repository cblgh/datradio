# Get started
* Install [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/install/). You will need Beaker at least pre-release of 0.8
* Visit dat://31efd7c43603b57d18d0dcc4e2a32bf5cae08ab5930071e4da3513dbc4c60f5f/ and make an **editable copy**  
*(psst. click on the **three dots** in the URL bar of Beaker to create an editable copy)*
* **Create dat archives and fill them with music.** (You create the archives with Beaker, outside of datradio).   
Paste the url of the archive into datradio's terminal, titled *i love tracks*.   
The tracks have now been added, and the archive is now monitored for future changes.
   * If you create an info.txt and place it beside your tracks, that will be used to provide extra info about 
      the tracks in that dat archive. This info is viewable by clicking  **INFO** beside any track in a playlist.
    * You can easily add and remove tracks using something like kodedninja's ntain:  
    Create an editable copy of dat://ntain-kodedninja.hashbase.io/ in beaker and visit
    https://github.com/kodedninja/ntain for more info.   
    Note: if you use ntain, you will have to add the dat archive as follows: dat://7331..1337**/files** (because that is where ntain puts its files).
* Check out the commands in the right sidebar
* To ensure the tracks in your playlist are available offline, you will currently have to manually seed
 them in Beaker. Future versions of Beaker will probably add an API that allows datradio to seed them
 automatically for you, but that is not the case right now.  
 So visit the archives in the left sidebar under *archives in playlist* and make sure they are seeded if
 you want to listen offline.
 *(psst. click on the **weird triangle-with-dots** thing in the url bar to **make sure things are
 seeded**)*
